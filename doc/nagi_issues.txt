Graphics only look good in v2.272 interpreter!!  maybe it was packaged with wrong one 
sound isn't good either.. had to work around it in nagi.. does it do the same for other old ones?

Demo Pack 4
-----------
If you run the pq demo right after the mother goose demo then the gun shots do not animate properly.  However, this is the same behaviour of the original interpreter.

Xmas Demo
---------
The sides of some of the scrolling text is missing.  This occurs on the original interpreter if you run 2.440 code on a 2.917 interpreter.

restore a game on the intro screen.. "press any key" is stuck on bottom

Escape Quest
------------
The right side of the status is meant to be missing during the intro. NAGI does this faithfully.

Botz
----
If you press Q AFTER the robots catch you and you're dead.. the thing hangs.  This happens in the original interpreter too.  'Q' works before you get caught though.


Funny Larry thing:
------------------
This works in the original interpreter too.

 - skip the questions (either by answering them or alt-x)
 - when outside the bar:
 - press alt-d for debug mode
 - then type "tp"
 - press enter or 0
 - you should go back to to the intro
 - press enter and you'll see something funny on the first screen when you walk around

it's a "bug".. but i thought it was cool.
